### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
Coding as I learned was really helpful for learning and solidifying what I learned. 
- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
Trying to incorporate everything I learned into my final project as I was still learning it let my code pretty scattered and disjointed. 
- How can you improve in the next module?
Next time, I can simplify and organize my code in more concise, pretty ways so it's easier to use and navigate. I could also structure things better and provide some way to navigate through it.
