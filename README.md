# Overview

This project analyzes a data set using python pandas to answer questions about student success based on a number of factors. 

The data set I used included socio-economic scores, study hours, sleep hours, attendance percentage, and grades. The data set can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/predict-student-performance-dataset)

The purpose of this project is to learn about and gain experience with data analysis using a familiar programming language.

# Data Analysis Results

### Question 1: 
- Does sleep or study hours have more of an impact on grades?
#### Answer: 
- We found that sleep doesn't have an high correlation with grades (-0.12) but study time has a high correlation (0.81).
Based on that, it seems that study time has a might higher impact on grades than sleep time. 

### Question 2:
- How many hours of studying are important to get good grades?
#### Answer: 
- The average student in the top 20% grade score studied for more than 7 hours, indicating that students who wish to be in the top 20% might want to aim for more than 7 hours of study time.
